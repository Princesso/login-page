<h1>Login Page Modeled After PluralSight's Login</h1>

<h2>Named PluralFlight</h2>

This is yet another project from me. Of course, I love to write code. <br>
Yeah, I know yo know!

<p>Anyways...I used HTML and CSS to design the login page.<br>
I used flex box to flesh it out. And I am getting a good hold of Flex now!</p>

<p>There are Javascript added yet but I'll be using VanillaJS to enhance the login functionality<br>
whenever I am ready to do so.</p>

<p>I designed the logo and took a background image from pexels.com<br>
from Aman Jakhar's collection. Thanks Aman and what a nice shot you have there!</p>

<p>That's pretty much it for this project.<br>
It's hosted on gh-pages and here's a link to it:<br>

<p>Thanks for checking out my repo again.</p>

<p>Kind regards,<br>
